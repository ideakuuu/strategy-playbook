# Client Retention Strategy (High-level)

1. Value Reinforcement Cadence
   - Day 7: "Quick wins" summary and next steps
   - Day 30: Results dossier + suggested optimizations
   - Day 60: Case-building activities (collect testimonials)
   - Day 90: Renewal conversation with tailored upsell offers

2. Churn Risk Signals (automated in CST)
   - Low engagement with deliverables
   - Missed approval cycles
   - Negative sentiment from client messages
   - Declining KPI trends

3. Retention Experiments
   - Success storytelling program: transform client wins into co-branded PR placed via CMC and partners.
   - Referral incentives: success fee + client credits for referred projects.
   - Quarterly workshops for power users to increase stickiness.

4. Measurement
   - Track renewal rate, NPS, time-to-first-delivery, and upsell conversion.
