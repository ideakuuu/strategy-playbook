# Case Study: Beam — Metrics-Driven Content & Renewal Playbook (Sample Playbook)

**Objective:** Improve renewal rates by demonstrating value through metrics and success stories.

**Strategy**
- Produce a "results dossier" every 30 days: includes CMC traffic lift, engagement metrics, comparative benchmarks, and recommendation playbook.
- Quarterly business review meetings with clients to present wins and negotiate renewals/upsells.
- Implement churn risk flags in the CST (low engagement, missed deliverables, negative sentiment).

**Execution**
- Built dashboard combining CMC metrics, social engagement, and campaign spend efficiency.
- Hosted quarterly review and presented a 90-day plan linked to product roadmap.

**KPIs & (Sample) Results**
- Renewal rate (simulated improvement): from 62% to 81% after implementing review cadence and dossiers.
- Upsells attributed: 14% of revenue in quarter after presenting data-driven recommendations.

**Retention & Upsell Opportunities**
- Success-story amplification on CMC Top Content and partner newsletters.
- Offer bespoke campaign bundles timed with product milestones.

**Takeaways**
- Demonstrable metrics and structured reviews materially increase renewal velocity.
- A predictable dossier/reporting cadence makes the client perceive continuous value.
