Hiring Team
Movimentum

Dear Movimentum Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Client Success / Account Manager role at Movimentum. I admire Movimentum’s mission — giving worthy tokens the visibility, momentum, and narrative they need to win — and I want to help you scale that mission as your frontline partner for clients.

Why I’m a strong fit:
- Client-first operator: I’ve onboarded and managed B2B clients in crypto and fintech, routinely serving as the single point of contact between sales, ops, and creative teams to deliver outcomes on time.
- Data-driven retention: I design and maintain Client Success Trackers, converted insights into upsells, and implemented retention programs that raised client renewal rates.
- Crypto marketing literacy: I understand token marketing KPIs (visibility on CoinMarketCap, listing-related flows, campaign CTR/engagement, narrative velocity) and can translate product goals into measurable campaigns.
- Rapid execution: I thrive in high-growth environments and can operationalize onboarding so clients are integrated with outsource teams within 24 hours of close.

What I will deliver in first 90 days:
1. A 24-hour onboarding guarantee process (checklists + automation triggers) so every new client has tasks assigned within an hour and full handoff inside 24 hours.
2. A weekly CST cadence with templated meeting notes, next-steps, and growth-opportunity flags to prioritize upsells and referrals.
3. Retention experiments — e.g., success storytelling program (leverage client wins as social proof), churn-risk alerts, and value-reinforcement touchpoints at 30/60/90 days.

I’m excited by how Movimentum blends creative content with performance-first thinking. I’d welcome the chance to show a sample onboarding runbook and the CST I’d use for your clients.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
